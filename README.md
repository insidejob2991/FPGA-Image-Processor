# FPGA-Image-Processor
A multi-language project demonstrating hardware acceleration for image processing. It uses Python to load a grayscale image into the FPGA's Block RAM (BRAM) and applies the Square Root ($\sqrt{P}$) algorithm using the CORDIC IP core. The processed pixel stream is output via a UART at a controlled rate
